Algorithm:

step 1:  create function which with single parameter, which will take argument 1 or 0.
step 2: Add expression using only operators from javascript which return output as below:
         1 -> 0
         0 -> 1

Program:

function compute(a)
{
    a=(a+1)%2;
    return (a)
}

compute(1);
